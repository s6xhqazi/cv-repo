# Leak

In this task we enabled **all** the nice exploit mitigations (see for yourself with `checksec`[^1])!
Try to exploit the binary with information that you extract "forcefully" from the binary!

Once again, edit the provided `solution` template to exploit the binary `leak` and print (only) the flag!

Your solution should execute like this:

```
$ ./solution
FLAG{some letters and digits}
```
