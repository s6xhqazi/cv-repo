# Shellter your code!

We finally removed the unnecessary code that you might have found in the previous task!
Is our new binary `shellter_your_code` still exploitable?

Again, edit the provided `solution` template to make it exploit the binary and print (only) the flag!

Your solution should execute like this:

```
$ ./solution
FLAG{some letters and digits}
```
