# Forking Server

In this task we enabled **all** the nice exploit mitigations (see for yourself with `checksec`)!
Try to exploit the `forkingserver` with all the know-how you got!

Edit the provided `solution` template to exploit the binary `forkingserver` and print (only) the flag!

Hint: This time you have to brute-force, **twice**! ðŸ˜Ž

Your solution should execute like this:

```
$ ./solution
FLAG{some letters and digits}
```
